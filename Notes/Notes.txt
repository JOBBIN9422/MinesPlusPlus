Neigbor Checking Notes

How does the function work?
	-Check if cell is on a corner or an edge (if row or col index is a max or min)
		-Corner - cell has 3 neighboring cells 
		-Edge - cell has 5 neighboring cells 
	-Count the number of adjacent cells that contain MINES:
		-If cell has zero mines:
			-Open the surrounding cells (recursive function)
		-If cell has 1 to 8 mines:
			-Do NOT call clearing function on this cell
			-Print the number of mines (set image to one of the number tiles)

From http://www.techuser.net/minecascade.html:

    1. If current square is a mine gameover, otherwise uncover square
    2. Count mines adjacent to current square
    3. If adjacent mine count is ZERO, uncover all adjacent covered squares 
	   and make a RECURSIVE CALL for every one of them (steps 2-3)

Chording Algorithm
	-If a cell is open and has adjacent cells containg mines: 
		-Count neighboring cells that are flagged 
		-If number of flagged cells == number of mined cells:
			-Open all adjacent cells (this can lose the game if flags are not placed
			 correctly)
